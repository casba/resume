    \item Created a command line application to interactively generate a number of project skeletons which would serve as a base for developers migrating away from the athena's old perl monolith and to a service based approach. These skeletons would have built in support for Docker and Jenkins pipelines. They would also serve to establish conventions as to how projects are structured, how test suites are written, and so on.
    \item Created a backend service that ties into the command line application. This service would be responsible for tracking the various services at athena and aggregating information for the purposes of documentation and discoverability. It is also responsible for the management of core services for applications it manages. Currently this involves automatically provisioning credentials used in our authentication workflow, automatically gathering coarse-grained authentication information from API specification files, and transforming and providing that coarse-grained data to our API Gateway so that the policies may be enforced.
    \item Implemented, proposed, and supported a number tools to enhance developer productivity. This included: a site that aggregated documentation and contact info for internal services and tools, built-in middleware tooling for static and dynamic HTML, perl linting and validation rules, and a perldoc site.
    \item Was responsible for maintence and feature additions to athena's perl-based web application framework.
